# Mapping Application

This project was built as part of the Coursera course "Advanced Data Structures in Java" by University of California San Diego. You can find this course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures?specialization=java-object-oriented).

The mapping application is built with the ability to provide and visualize routes from one point to another in a map.
